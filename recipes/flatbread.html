        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of flour (any kind)</li>
            <li>1 cup of ale, buttermilk or jogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the ale/water and stir until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 6-8 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece into a ball and then flatten it with a rolling pin or hand until it is about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and brush the surface with a little olive oil.</li>
            <li>Place a flatbread in the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until it is puffed and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining flatbreads.</li>
            <li>Serve the flatbreads warm, with your choice of toppings or dips.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also customize the flatbread by adding herbs or spices to the dough, or by brushing the top with a mixture of herbs and spices before cooking. Enjoy!</p>
